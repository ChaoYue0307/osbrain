# # When connecting to an ASYNC_REP some things happen:
# #  - A PUSH socket is created with an alias

# #    knows where to send requests that come from that agent. Should a new
# #    PULL socket be created instead for each connection?
# client.connect(addr, alias='async')
# #  - Send will have a special send_async_req case
# #  - handler, wait, repeat, on_error could have default values set on connect()
# #  - send will add UUID of the agent and an UUID for the request
# #  - a timer is created to wait for the response before raising...
# client.send('async', 'a request here...',

# # For PUB-SUB there will be another special AddressKind (i.e.: STREAM?),
