What is osBrain?
----------------
osBrain is a **general-purpose multi-agent system module** written in Python.
Agents run independently as system processes and communicate with each other
using message passing.

osBrain uses `Ã˜MQ <http://zeromq.org/>`_ for efficient and flexible messsage
passing between agents. It also uses `Pyro4 <https://pythonhosted.org/Pyro4/>`_
to ease the configuration and deployment of complex systems.
